1. What are Directives?
--> Classes that add additional behavior to elements in our Angular Applications. Directives are basically instructions to the DOM.

2. What are the types of Directives?
--> 
    a) Components: Directives with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type
    b) Structural Directives: Change the DOM layout or view of a webpage by adding or removing DOM elements from the webpage
    c) Attribute Directives: Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive
** Basic HTML validations can be used to validate the form fields. In the case of custom validations, directives can be used. 

3) Mention some common built-in Structural Directives.
--> 
    •	NgIf: Adds or removes subviews or elements from the template based on condition. 
        When NgIf is false, Angular removes an element and its descendants from the DOM and creates and displays when it is true.
    •	NgFor: Used to repeat a node or a portion of HTML template for each item in an iterable list.
    •	NgSwitch: A set of directives that switch among alternative views.

4) Mention some common built-in Attribute Directives.
--> 
    •	NgClass: Adds and removes a set of CSS classes to elements conditionally
    •	NgStyle: Adds and removes a set of HTML styles to elements conditionally
    •	NgModel: Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element
