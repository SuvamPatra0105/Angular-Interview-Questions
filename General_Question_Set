1. What is transpiling in Angular?
--> Transpiling is the process of transforming the source code of one programming language into the source code of another. Typically, in Angular, this implies translating TypeScript to JavaScript. TypeScript can be used to develop code for your Angular application, which is subsequently transpiled to JavaScript. This occurs naturally and internally.
