1. Differentiate between Observables and Promises.
--> 

Observables--- Emit multiple values over a period of time.
Promises--- Emit a single value at a time.

Observables--- Are lazy: they’re not executed until we subscribe to them using the subscribe() method.
Promises--- Are not lazy(eager): execute immediately after creation.

Observables: Have subscriptions that are cancellable using the unsubscribe() method, which stops the listener from receiving further values.
Promises: Are not cancellable.

Observables--- Provide the map for forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen operators.
Promises--- Don’t provide any operations.

Observables--- Deliver errors to the subscribers.
Promises--- Push errors to the child promises.
